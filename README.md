# Statistical Analysis and Survey Functions

This R script contains various statistical analysis techniques using survey data. It demonstrates how to load datasets, perform survey analysis, calculate statistics, and use sampling techniques.

## Requirements

The following R packages are required:
- `survey`
- `SDaA`

Install them using:
```r
install.packages("survey")
install.packages("SDaA")
```
# Simple Random Sampling in R

This R script demonstrates the process of performing simple random sampling and basic statistical analysis on a dataset. The script includes importing data, calculating mean, variance, covariance, confidence intervals, and generating random samples.

## Libraries Used
- `readr`: For importing CSV data.

## Steps Covered in the Script
1. **Data Import**: Import data from a CSV file and view it.
2. **Basic Statistical Analysis**: 
   - Mean, variance, covariance calculations.
   - Confidence interval calculations using standard error and t-distribution.
3. **Random Sampling**: 
   - Sampling from vectors.
   - Sampling from normal and t-distributions.
4. **Data Visualization**: 
   - Histograms, boxplots, and bar plots.
5. **Statistical Distributions**: 
   - Example of binomial and normal distribution sampling.
